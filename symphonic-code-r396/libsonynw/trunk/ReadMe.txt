TODO:
(excuse me for my english but i don't want to pass more time on wrtiting this rather than looking after the code)

-For the moment the main is just an example.We have to code it to use the library
 Like that we will have a test application (console line mode) for our library.
 So go ahead! :)

-All methodes using "driveLetter" needs to be re-write beacause of no-portability.
 driverLetter is a char where in Linux and mac it will be a path.
 could be named "pathdrive"

-"updateDiskSpaceInfo" need to be modified or changed.

-perhaps change all path to posix path type.
