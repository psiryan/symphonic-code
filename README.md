# symphonic-code

## Description
A portable MP3/WMA/OGG/FLAC file manager for Sony players. Simply copy it on your usb player and use it wherever you are! It is an alternative to SonicStage. (Was NW-E00x Mp3 File Manager...)

## Summary
This is a fork from the abandoned project at [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/symphonic/code/HEAD/tree/). Migrating as a personal project to make it work in my modern Linux (Arch). If you would like to help contribute and keep it alive, find bugs on other platforms, etc then let me know or fork it.
